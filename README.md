Qualitative - words  
quantitative - numerical  
discrete - exact values - whole number  
continuous - non exact, eg hight to nearest cm

Statistics is the analysis of quantitative data

Discrete data  
10 score : 9, 8, 7, 10, 9, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6  
Raw data
easier to put in a table 
Frequency distrubutio

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Score (x) | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| Frequency (f) | 2   | 3   | 2   | 2   | 1   |

Range - measure of dispeartion - highest value subtract lowest
10 - 6 = 4

Mode - Most frequent - Highest frequency in table 
mode = 7 - can have multiple modes

Median - the value exactly in the middle

not effected by extremevalue

haveto arrange the data in order

find the mid point

6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10

if there are 2 numbers in the middle you take the average of 2

0, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10

the easiest way to get the median is **(n+1)/2**

(11+1)/2 = 6th value

median = 7


Mean - what most people mean when we say average

to find the mean we add all value and divide by the total number of values
6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10 /10
x = 7.7

data = sum of data/total amount data

Σ x = add all values of x

Standard Deviation
the mean Displacement from the mean
a measure of how spread out the numbers 
calculated as the square root of the variance 

Variance - a statistacal measurement of the spread between numbers

this is the hard formula
Var = Sum(x -mean)²/n

THis is the one they reccomend
Var = sum(x²)/n - mean²

variance of frequency distrubution formula

= sum(fx²)/sum(f)-mean²

Standard deviation is the better value

to get the standard devialtion you square root the original formula 

sqrt(sum(x²)/n - mean²)
